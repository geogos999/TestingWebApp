# üöÄ Testing Framework Learning Roadmap

## üìö **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**

### Learn Playwright Basics
1. **Setup & Configuration**
   - Install dependencies: `cd tests/playwright && npm install`
   - Run first test: `npm test`
   - Explore test results in HTML report: `npm run test:report`

2. **Core Concepts**
   - Page Object Model pattern
   - Test structure and organization
   - Selectors and locators (prioritize data-testid)
   - Async/await patterns

3. **Hands-on Practice**
   ```bash
   # Generate tests with Playwright codegen
   npm run test:codegen
   
   # Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
   npm run test:headed
   
   # Debug tests step by step
   npm run test:debug
   ```

### Essential Resources
- [Playwright Documentation](https://playwright.dev/)
- [Page Object Model Best Practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/pom)
- [Testing Best Practices](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices)

## üîß **Phase 2: Page Object Model (Week 3-4)**

### Build Complete Page Objects
1. **Create page objects for each major page**:
   - `HomePage.ts` - Product listing, navigation
   - `ProductPage.ts` - Product details, add to cart
   - `CartPage.ts` - Cart management
   - `CheckoutPage.ts` - Order placement
   - `AdminDashboard.ts` - Admin functions

2. **Common Patterns**:
   ```typescript
   // Good: Use data-testid selectors
   private readonly addToCartButton = '[data-testid="add-to-cart-button"]';
   
   // Good: Create reusable actions
   async addProductToCart(productId: string): Promise<void> {
     await this.goto(`/products/${productId}`);
     await this.clickElement(this.addToCartButton);
     await this.expectVisible('[data-testid="cart-notification"]');
   }
   ```

### Test Categories to Implement
1. **Authentication Tests** ‚úÖ (Already started)
2. **Product Browsing Tests**
3. **Shopping Cart Tests**
4. **Checkout Flow Tests**
5. **Admin Functionality Tests**
6. **API Integration Tests**

## üöÄ **Phase 3: GitHub Actions (Week 5-6)**

### GitHub Actions Learning Path
1. **Basic Concepts**
   - Workflows, jobs, and steps
   - Triggers (push, PR, schedule)
   - Environment variables and secrets

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Application building and testing
   - Test result reporting
   - Artifact management
   - Deployment strategies

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Matrix builds (multiple browsers/environments)
   - Conditional execution
   - Parallel job execution
   - Security scanning integration

### GitHub Actions Resources
- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
- [Marketplace Actions](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)
- [Security Best Practices](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides)

## üß™ **Phase 4: Advanced Testing (Week 7-8)**

### Advanced Testing Techniques
1. **Visual Regression Testing**
   ```typescript
   await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('homepage.png');
   ```

2. **API Testing Integration**
   ```typescript
   const response = await request.get('/api/products');
   expect(response.status()).toBe(200);
   ```

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Lighthouse integration
   - Network monitoring
   - Resource usage tracking

4. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Mobile viewports
   - Accessibility testing

### Testing Strategies
1. **Test Pyramid Approach**
   - Unit tests (backend)
   - Integration tests (API)
   - E2E tests (UI flows)

2. **Data Management**
   - Test data factories
   - Database seeding strategies
   - Test isolation

## üìä **Phase 5: Monitoring & Reporting (Week 9-10)**

### Test Reporting & Monitoring
1. **Rich Test Reports**
   - HTML reports with screenshots
   - Video recordings of failures
   - Trace files for debugging

2. **GitHub Integration**
   - PR comments with test results
   - GitHub Pages for report hosting
   - Status checks and branch protection

3. **Metrics & Analytics**
   - Test execution trends
   - Flaky test identification
   - Performance benchmarks
